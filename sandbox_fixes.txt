Things are a bit in the wrong order:

sigaction intialization should be below the fork in main process (so its not inherited)
the SA_RESTART should be before sigaction function is called
there is a bit of a mistake inside WIFSIGNALED:

if (exitcode == SIGKILL)
		{
			if (verbose && timeout > 0)
				printf("Bad function: timed out after %i seconds\n", timeout);
		}
		else
		{
			if (verbose)
				printf("Bad function: %s\n", strsignal(exitcode));
		}
